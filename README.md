# django-bucketeerstorage
Use Bucketeer with Heroku as a Django backend

## Why?
Heroku has an ephemeral file system to which you cannot save image files or other files.  While they recommend using S3 to store objects, you may find it easier to just get an add-on that does it for you (like Bucketeer).

## How?

TBD ;)
